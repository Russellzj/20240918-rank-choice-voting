## What is Ranked Choice Voting?

Ranked choice voting (RCV) is a voting system where voters rank candidates in order of preference, instead of choosing just one. For example, instead of only picking one candidate, you would list them like this:

1. Candidate A (Your first choice)
2. Candidate B (Your second choice)
3. Candidate C (Your third choice)

> It's important to note that _Ranked Choice Voting_ is a broad term. It can refer to several different voting methods that use ranked ballots. Different versions of ranked voting systems exist, and today, we will focus on a specific method called _instant-runoff voting (IRV)_.

### Why Use Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)?

Ranked choice voting helps to address common problems in elections. For example, in some systems, similar candidates can split votes between them, which allows another candidate to win with less overall support. With RCV, even if your favorite candidate doesn’t win, your vote can still help determine the outcome through your next preferences.

## How Does Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) Work?

Instant-runoff voting is a method of ranked choice voting designed for single-winner elections. Here's a general overview of how it works (note that this explanation doesn't cover all edge cases):

1. **First, count all the first-choice votes**. If any candidate gets more than 50% of the votes, they win.
2. **If no candidate gets over 50%**, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated.
3. **Redistribute the votes** from the eliminated candidate to the voters' next choice.
4. **Repeat the process** of eliminating candidates and redistributing votes until one candidate gets more than 50% and wins.

### Why Use Instant Runoff Voting?

Instant Runoff Voting helps ensure that the winner has broader support by considering voters' next most-preferred candidate if their top candidate is eliminated. This prevents a candidate from winning with just a small percentage of the vote in a crowded race.

## What is a Cast Vote Record (CVR)?

A **Cast Vote Record (CVR)** is a data representation how each voter ranked the candidates. Different voting system vendors may have different formats for CVRs, but for this kata, we are using a simple CSV format. Here’s an example of a CVR file using our generic CSV format:

```
BallotID,Alice,Bob,Carlos,David,Erin,Frank
000,4,1,6,3,5,2
001,2,5,4,1,3,6
002,3,6,2,5,4,1
003,1,2,5,4,6,3
004,6,3,1,2,4,5
005,5,4,2,6,1,3
006,2,3,6,1,5,4
007,4,6,3,2,1,5
008,1,5,4,6,2,3
009,3,2,6,5,1,4
```

In this example:
- Each row represents a single voter’s ranking of the candidates.
- The columns after **BallotID** represent the candidates: **Alice, Bob, Carlos, David, Erin, and Frank**.
- The numbers in each row indicate the ranking a voter gave to each candidate. For example, in the first row (BallotID `000`), the voter ranked **Bob** as their first choice (`1`), **Frank** as their second choice (`2`), **David** as their third choice (`3`), and so on.

## Your Challenge

For this kata, you’ll implement the **Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)** algorithm. Here's what you need to do for each test election:

1. **Read the CVR** election data from the CSV file which contains ranked ballots from voters.
2. **Process the election** by running rounds of counting, eliminating candidates with the fewest votes, and redistributing those votes.
3. **Output the winner** after all rounds are complete (i.e. once a candidate has received 50% of the remaining votes).

You will be given some mock test elections (formatted as CSV files) and the expected results (provided in either JSON or CSV format). Your goal is to write code that reads the election data, runs the IRV process, and produces the correct winner.

## How to Get Started

1. Pick the programming language you’re most comfortable with.
2. Open the "Templates" directory to find starter code and unit tests.
3. Follow the principles of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** by writing tests first and building your solution step by step.

## Test Elections Directory Structure

Each test election will be stored in its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find:

- **README.md**: A brief explanation of the test election.
- **cvr.csv**: The Cast Vote Record for the test election, which you'll process.
- **expect_results_summary.json** or **expect_results_summary.csv**: These files contain the expected election outcome. You can use either format.
- **config.json**: This file was generated by RCTab when the presenter created the test election. It is not required to complete the assignment, and was only provided in the repo for debugging or facilitator support.

### Extra Challenge: More Edge Cases

If you have extra time, you can explore how you might handle some extra edge cases that weren't covered in the test elections.

- Handling ties (there are a few different ways tie-breaks can occur: physical coin toss during tabulation; random number generated from a seed; a randomly-generated tie-break list created prior to tabulation)
- Excluded candidates (e.g. undeclared write-ins, candidate dropouts, candidates invalidated after being added to the ballot)
- Custom Configuration: inject custom configuration options into your code to allow for different rules (e.g. different tie-break methods)

You will have to create your own test elections for these, but by now you should understand enough of the fundamentals of how a generic CSV CVR works in order to create one.

## Additional Notes

See solutions in different languages in the "Templates" directory. Once you decide which language you'd like to use, simply open that directory in your favorite IDE, and you should be able to run the included unit tests "out of the box".
