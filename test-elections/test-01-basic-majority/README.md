# Basic Majority Winner Test

In this test, we're simulating a voting scenario between two popular text editors: **Vim** and **Emacs**. The voters will choose which editor they prefer, and the goal is to determine the winner using Instant Runoff Voting (IRV).

In this election, one candidate will receive more than 50% of the first-choice votes right from the start. This means there will be no need for additional rounds or elimination of candidates. 

### Candidates
- **Vim**: A highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It's known for its keyboard-centric interface.
- **Emacs**: Another popular text editor, known for its extensibility and a large set of features, including a built-in Lisp interpreter.

### Objective
Run the IRV process to determine the winner. Since one candidate will have a majority of the first-choice votes, the winner should be identified after the first round.

### Files
- **cvr.csv**: The Cast Vote Record for the test election, which you'll process.
- **expect_results_summary.json** or **expect_results_summary.csv**: These files contain the expected election outcome. You can use either format.
- **config.json**: This file was generated by RCTab when the presenter created the test election. It is not required to complete the assignment, and was only provided in the repo for debugging or facilitator support.
