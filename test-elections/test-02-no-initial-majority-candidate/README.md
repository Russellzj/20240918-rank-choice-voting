# No Initial Majority Candidate Test

In this test, we simulate an election with three candidates: **Alice**, **Bob**, and **Carlos**. No candidate wins a majority of the first-choice votes. In the first round, Alice has the most votes, but still less than 50%. Instead of declaring Alice the winner based on plurality, **Carlos**, who has the fewest votes, will be **eliminated**, and his votes will be redistributed based on the voters' second-choice preferences.

> Note: This test also demonstrates why we donâ€™t just go with the candidate with the most votes in the first round, as vote redistribution (based on voters
 second choice) changes the outcome.

### Candidates
- **Alice**: Starts with the most votes, but less than a majority.
- **Bob**: Initially has fewer votes than Alice but benefits from redistribution.
- **Carlos**: Receives the fewest votes in the first round and is eliminated.

### Objective
Run the IRV process to determine the winner. After Carlos is eliminated, his votes are redistributed, and the final result will show that Bob, not Alice, wins after redistribution.

### Files
- **cvr.csv**: The Cast Vote Record for the test election, which you'll process.
- **expect_results_summary.json** or **expect_results_summary.csv**: These files contain the expected election outcome. You can use either format.
- **config.json**: This file was generated by RCTab when the presenter created the test election. It is not required to complete the assignment, and was only provided in the repo for debugging or facilitator support.
