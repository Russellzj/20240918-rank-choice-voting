# Multiple Rounds of Elimination Test

In this test, we simulate an election with 7 candidates. No candidate secures more than 50% of the votes in the first round, so multiple rounds of elimination are required before a winner is determined. The candidate with the fewest votes in each round will be **eliminated**, and their votes will be redistributed based on voters' next preferences.

This test checks whether the IRV process correctly handles multiple rounds of elimination and redistribution until a candidate wins with a majority after 4 eliminations.

### Candidates
- **Alice**
- **Bob**
- **Carlos**
- **David**
- **Erin**
- **Frank**

### Objective
Run the IRV process and continue eliminating candidates until a candidate wins with a majority. After four candidates are eliminated, the remaining candidate with the most votes should be the winner.

### Files
- **cvr.csv**: The Cast Vote Record for the test election, which you'll process.
- **expect_results_summary.json** or **expect_results_summary.csv**: These files contain the expected election outcome. You can use either format.
- **config.json**: This file was generated by RCTab when the presenter created the test election. It is not required to complete the assignment, and was only provided in the repo for debugging or facilitator support.
