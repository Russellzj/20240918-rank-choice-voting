# Edge Case: Exhausted Ballot

In this test, we simulate an election with 3 candidates: **Alice**, **Bob**, and **Carlos**. One of the voters does not rank all of the candidates, and after their top choices are eliminated, their ballot becomes "exhausted" (they have no remaining preferences).

This tests the program's ability to handle a ballot that becomes exhausted, ensuring that the election can still proceed correctly even when some ballots no longer have valid preferences to redistribute.

> Note: Voters don't have to give rankings to all candidates.

### Candidates
- **Alice**
- **Bob**
- **Carlos**

### Objective
Run the IRV process and ensure that the program correctly handles the exhausted ballot without causing errors or miscounting. After one round of elimination, the winner should be determined.

### Files
- **cvr.csv**: The Cast Vote Record for the test election, which you'll process.
- **expect_results_summary.json** or **expect_results_summary.csv**: These files contain the expected election outcome. You can use either format.
- **config.json**: This file was generated by RCTab when the presenter created the test election. It is not required to complete the assignment, and was only provided in the repo for debugging or facilitator support.
