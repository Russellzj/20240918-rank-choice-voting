# Edge Case: No Majority, All Candidates Eliminated Except One

In this test, we simulate an election with 3 candidates: **Alice**, **Bob**, and **Carlos**. Not all voters rank all the candidates, so no candidate ever secures a majority of votes. The winner is chosen after all other candidates have been eliminated.

This tests the programâ€™s ability to handle an election where the final winner is selected by elimination, even though no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote.

> Note: While in this case the winner will not have a majority of _all_ the votes, they will have a majority of the non-exhausted ballots. This is why many RCV advocates recommend for voters to **rank all** candidates. As long as a voter has continuing ranked candidates in later rounds, their ballot continues to express their preferences (even if their most-preferred candidates have been eliminated).

### Candidates
- **Alice**
- **Bob**
- **Carlos**

### Objective
Run the IRV process and ensure that the program correctly eliminates candidates in sequence until only one candidate remains, even though no candidate secures a majority.

### Files
- **cvr.csv**: The Cast Vote Record for the test election, which you'll process.
- **expect_results_summary.json** or **expect_results_summary.csv**: These files contain the expected election outcome. You can use either format.
- **config.json**: This file was generated by RCTab when the presenter created the test election. It is not required to complete the assignment, and was only provided in the repo for debugging or facilitator support.
