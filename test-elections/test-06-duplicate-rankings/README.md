# Edge Case: Duplicate Rankings

In this test, we simulate an election with 3 candidates: **Alice**, **Bob**, and **Carlos**. If a voter assigns the same ranking to multiple candidates (e.g., Alice and Bob both ranked as first choice), the ballot becomes exhausted and no further preferences are counted. This test covers both first-choice and second-choice duplicate rankings to ensure the system handles them correctly.

### Candidates
- **Alice**
- **Bob**
- **Carlos**

### Objective
Run the IRV process and ensure that the program exhausts a ballot when a duplicate ranking is encountered. Both first and second choices are tested for duplicates, and the election proceeds correctly without selecting a winner too early.

### Files
- **cvr.csv**: The Cast Vote Record for the test election, which you'll process.
- **expect_results_summary.json** or **expect_results_summary.csv**: These files contain the expected election outcome. You can use either format.
- **config.json**: This file was generated by RCTab when the presenter created the test election. It is not required to complete the assignment, and was only provided in the repo for debugging or facilitator support.
