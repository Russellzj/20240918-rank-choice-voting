# Edge Case: Skipped Rankings

In this test, we simulate an election with 5 candidates: **Alice**, **Bob**, **Carlos**, **David**, and **Erin**. Some voters skip rankings, leaving gaps in their preferences (e.g., a first and third choice but no second choice). The expected behavior in this test is that no further tabulation is done once a skipped ranking is found.

> **Note:** In real-world elections, some jurisdictions may handle skipped rankings differently, continuing to tabulate or ignoring the skipped rank.

### Candidates
- **Alice**
- **Bob**
- **Carlos**
- **David**
- **Erin**

### Objective
Run the IRV process and ensure that the program **stops tabulating** once a skipped ranking is encountered.

### Files
- **cvr.csv**: The Cast Vote Record for the test election, which you'll process.
- **expect_results_summary.json** or **expect_results_summary.csv**: These files contain the expected election outcome. You can use either format.
- **config.json**: This file was generated by RCTab when the presenter created the test election. It is not required to complete the assignment, and was only provided in the repo for debugging or facilitator support.
